# Using IAP to gate access to Atlantis

This guide explains how to use IAP to gate access to your Atlantis deployment. For more information on this module, see [`basic example`](https://github.com/bschaatsbergen/atlantis-on-gcp-vm/tree/master/examples/basic).

# Why you should use IAP

IAP allows you to put Google Auth (or an external SSO provider, if added outside Terraform) in front of the Atlantis UI, which is otherwise open to the world. For more on IAP specifically, see the [`Google docs on IAP`](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/concepts-overview).

Note that only internal org IAP clients can be created via Terraform. External clients must be manually created via the GCP console. This is due to a current restriction in the Google API.

## Prerequisites

This module expects that you already own or create the below resources yourself.

- Google network, subnetwork and a Cloud NAT
- Service account, [specifics can be found here](../../README.md#service-account)
- Domain, [specifics can be found here](../../README.md#dns-record)

If you prefer an example that includes the above resources, see [`complete example`](https://github.com/bschaatsbergen/atlantis-on-gcp-vm/tree/master/examples/complete).

## How to deploy

See [`main.tf`](https://github.com/bschaatsbergen/atlantis-on-gcp-vm/tree/master/examples/basic/main.tf) and the [`server-atlantis.yaml`](https://github.com/bschaatsbergen/atlantis-on-gcp-vm/tree/master/examples/basic/server-atlantis.yaml).

## After it's successfully deployed

Once you're done, see [Configuring Webhooks for Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/configuring-webhooks.html#configuring-webhooks)
